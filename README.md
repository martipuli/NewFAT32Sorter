NewFAT32Sorter
==============

Sorts Files on FAT, FAT32 devices, with GUI, easy to use



05.01.2014


 ============================================================================

Right now, the application copies files from one direction to another. The user 
decides in which order the files are copied, what leads to a sorted order on a 
regular FAT32 drive.


 - Copies files in a given order
 - File extension filter
 - Copies only new files
 - Subfolders included

 ============================================================================

System requirements:
 - Java 7

 ============================================================================

Built with NetBeans, tested in Microsoft Windows 7. 
Using to copy files Apache Commons IO.

 ============================================================================

Start the application:
 - Download and extract the repository
 - Start application with clicking "NewFAT32Sorter.jar" with mouse
 
 ============================================================================
 
 
 ToDo's:
  - Show Output in realtime
  - Save vars in a file
  - make better code (error messages, ...)
  - Work on GUI 
  - Implement "Fast Sorting" (Move files, instead of copiing them)
  - User defined exclusion of folders
